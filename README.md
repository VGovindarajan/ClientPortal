This is a learning project to implement an Client Portal for an FCM using a Restful API based backend.
This uses SwiftUI for designing / implementing the front end.
Swift is the main programming language for the front end.
The backend system is written in Python and uses Flask / Gunicorn as the API server.
Here are some WIP images
